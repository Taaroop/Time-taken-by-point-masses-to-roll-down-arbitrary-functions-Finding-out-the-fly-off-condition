# Time-taken-by-point-masses-to-roll-down-arbitrary-functions-Finding-out-the-fly-off-condition
# This semi-research paper focuses on finding out the time taken by a point mass to roll down an arbitrary function f(x) from x_0 to x_f.
# In addition, we explore the condition under which our formula is applicable, i.e., we find out the 'fly-off' condition of the point mass.
